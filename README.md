# Breast Cancer Prediction with ANN

This project implements a Breast Cancer prediction model using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The model is trained on the Breast Cancer dataset and predicts whether a tumor is **Malignant** or **Benign**. The app is built using **Streamlit** for an interactive user experience.

## Project Structure

- `model.py`: Script for training and saving the machine learning model.
- `generate_pkl.py`: Script to generate `breast_cancer_ann_model.pkl` and `scaler.pkl` files.
- `app.py`: Streamlit application for user interaction and prediction.
- `breast_cancer_ann_model.pkl`: The trained Artificial Neural Network model.
- `scaler.pkl`: The trained scaler used to preprocess data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `streamlit`
- `scikit-learn`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `joblib`
